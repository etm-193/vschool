# Mid Level Skill Check

This is a time for you to test your coding skills and prepare yourself for an interview. Below you will see two code challenges for you to complete. You will also need to add comments or pseudo-code to your project in order to talk through your process and solutions. Next you will complete a quiz that will test the knowledge you have gained so far. Once you have completed the challenges, schedule an assessment to review with an instructor where you will complete a third coding challenge live! 

## Code Challenges -->

<!-- 

Challenge 1:  Constructor Functions

Create a constructor function called **`Book`** that takes in parameters for **`title`**, **`author`**, and **`year`**. The constructor function should have a method called **`getDetails`** that returns a string with the book's title, author, and year.  Instantiate two new Books using the below code to test your solution.
